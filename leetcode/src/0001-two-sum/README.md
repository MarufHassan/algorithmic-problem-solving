# [1. Two Sum][title]

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers, return `indices` of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have `exactly` one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solution


```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

## Test

Compile with `javac Solution.java` and run with `java -ea Solution`.
