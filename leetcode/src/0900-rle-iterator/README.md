# [900. RLE Iterator][title]

## Problem Description

Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by RLEIterator(int[] A), where A is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even i, A[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value A[i+1] is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: next(int n), which exhausts the next n elements (n >= 1) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, next returns -1 instead.

For example, we start with A = [3,8,0,9,2,5], which is a run-length encoding of the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].  This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
Explanation: 
RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.
```

## Solution

```java
class RLEIterator {
private int[] seq;
private int ptr;

public RLEIterator(int[] A) {
    seq = A;
    ptr = 0;
}

public int next(int n) {
    while (ptr < seq.length && n > seq[ptr]) {
        n -= seq[ptr];
        ptr += 2;
    }
    
    if (ptr >= seq.length)  return -1;
    
    seq[ptr] -= n;
    
    return seq[ptr + 1];
}
}
```
