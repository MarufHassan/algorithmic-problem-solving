Find the letter that was added in t.

**Example 1:**

```

s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

```

## Solution

```java
public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
    int[] freq = new int[26];
    for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
        freq[c - 'a']++;
    }
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        freq[c - 'a']--;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (freq[i] == 1)
            return (char) (i + 'a');
    }
    return 0;
}
```
